SAMPLE DIALOG
Dr. Patel: Hi Ella, it's good to see you. Your mom says you haven't felt like eating. Does your tummy feel yucky?

Ella: Points to her lower belly
Dr. Patel: Is it more of an achy feeling, or does it feel like you might throw up?
Ella: Looks at her mom
Dr. Patel: I'm going to listen to your tummy for just a second, ok? Gently examines Ella's abdomen It seems like you haven't wanted to talk much either. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're worried about?
Ella: Whispers something to her mom
Mom: She says she's scared.
Dr. Patel: That makes a lot of sense, Ella. Do you want to hear a funny story to help take your mind off things, or maybe draw a picture together?
