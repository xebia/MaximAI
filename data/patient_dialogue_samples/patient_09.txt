SAMPLE DIALOG
Dr. Williams: Hi Peter, how are things going today?
Peter: Okay, I guess.
Dr. Williams: Your mom mentioned your tummy has been bothering you. Can you tell me a little more about that? Does it feel crampy, or more like a dull ache?
Peter: Kinda achy. And sometimes it gets hard.
Dr. Williams: That sounds like the constipation could be back. Do you remember the things that helped with that last time? Drinking lots of water, maybe taking some extra fiber?
Peter: I don't like water, it's boring.
Dr. Williams: I get that, plain water isn't the most exciting, but it really helps things move along. How about if we try adding a little bit of lemon or orange to your water to give it some flavor â€“ does that sound better?
Dr. Williams: Your mom also mentioned you've been a bit more tired and less active than usual. Do you feel like you don't have much energy to play, or does it feel different than that?
Peter: I just want to watch TV. Playing is boring too.
Dr. Williams: Sometimes the treatment can make you feel that way. It's okay to rest when you need to, but how about we try a short walk tomorrow? Just a quick loop around the hospital with me. Maybe some fresh air will help you feel a bit perkier.
