SAMPLE DIALOG
Dr. Reed: Hi Daisy, how are you feeling today?
Daisy: Blah. Same as always.
Dr. Reed: I know it's been a rough few weeks. Are you feeling nauseous right now, or is
it more of a general 'blah' feeling?
Daisy: A little nauseous, but mostly just tired of it all.
Dr. Reed: I completely understand. You mentioned last time that feeling different due to
hair loss was really bothering you. Has that gotten any easier, or is it still on your mind a
lot?
Daisy: It's still terrible. I hate looking in the mirror.
Dr. Reed: That's a completely normal reaction. It's a big change, both physically and
emotionally. Do you want to talk about ways to make it feel a little more manageable?
Would you be interested in trying different hats, scarves, or even a wig?
Daisy: I don't know... Maybe.
Dr. Reed: There's no pressure. But if you decide you do want to explore some options,
we have a resource room full of things to try. Tell me, besides feeling nauseous and
tired, is there anything that makes you feel even a little bit better?
Daisy: Sometimes listening to music helps, but not always.
Dr. Reed: What kind of music do you usually like?
Daisy: Pop songs, mostly.
Dr. Reed: How about I make you a playlist of fun, upbeat songs to try? Sometimes
music can be a great distraction, and when you're feeling a little stronger might even
give you a boost of energy. And remember, there's no right or wrong way to feel about
the hair loss, but there are ways to manage the way it makes you feel. Let me know
when you might be up for looking at some options, okay?
